#md5-cracker #md5 #hash #crack #cracker #password

A dynamic web application for cracking MD5 passwords, for teaching purposes. Made in PHP.

There are two modes: PIN mode and advanced mode. In PIN mode only PIN hashes can be cracked. In the advanced mode the user can input minimum and maximum password lengths, as well as the supposed password's character domain of the hash to be cracked.

This app will soon be hosted in a permanent web domain, alongside my other web projects.
